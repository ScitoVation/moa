Several classification parameters are provided in the toolbox in order to evaluate the classification performances both in fitting and in cross-validation. The classification parameters are provided as MATLAB structure (class_param) by the routines model_cpann, model_skn, model_xyf, and cv_cpann, cv_skn, cv_xyf. In the first case, the results refer to the classification estimation in fitting, in the second case in cross-validation. The classification parameters can be analysed by typing, in the MATLAB command window:<BR>
			<div id="tab_duo_text" class="text_math">
		      model.res.class_param

<BR>
		        when fitting the model, i.e. with the routine model_cpann, or <BR>

			<BR>
			when cross-validating the model, i.e. with the routines dacv, plsdacv, knncv and cartcv.<BR>
            <BR>
The calculated classification parameters are:<BR>
<BR>
<strong>the confusion matrix</strong> (conf_mat) <BR>
is a square matrix with dimensions G x G + 1, where G is the number of classes. Each element n<sub>gk</sub> represent the number of samples belonging to class g and assigned to class k. The last column collects the number of samples not assigned.<BR>
<center>
  <img src="math_formula_confmat.gif" width="401" height="182">
</center>
<BR>
<strong>precision<br>
</strong>represents the capability of a classification model to not include samples of other classes in the considered class. It can be measured as the ratio between the samples of the g-th class correctly classified and the total number of samples assigned to that class:<br>
<center>
  <img src="math_formula_precision.gif" width="72" height="51">
</center>
where n'<sub>g</sub> is the total number of samples assigned to the g-th class and n<sub>gg</sub> is the number of samples belonging to class g and correctly assigned to class g.<br>
<br>
<strong>sensitivity</strong><br>
describes the model ability to correctly recognize samples belonging to the g-th class and is defined as:<br>
<center>
  <img src="math_formula_sensitivity.gif" width="71" height="51">
</center>
where n<sub>g</sub> is the total number of samples belonging to the g-th class. Samples of the g-th class which were not assigned are not considered for the sensitivity calculation.<br>
<br>
<strong>specificity</strong><br>
characterizes the ability of the g-th class to reject the samples of all the other classes and is defined as:<BR>
<center>
  <img src="math_formula_specificity.gif" width="223" height="75">
</center>
where n'<sub>k</sub> is the total number of samples assigned to the k-th class: <BR>
<center>
  <img src="math_formula_nk.gif" width="80" height="51">
</center>
Not assigned samples are not considered for the specificity calculation.<BR>
<br>
<strong>accuracy</strong> (ac) <br>
is the ratio of correctly assigned samples:<BR>
<center>
  <img src="math_formula_accuracy.gif" width="103" height="82">
</center>
where n is the total number of samples. Not assigned samples are not considered for the accuracy calculation.<BR>
<br>
<strong>ratio of not assigned samples </strong> (not_ass)<BR>
is the ratio of the samples that have not been recognized and classified in the modelled classes. It is calculated as the sum of the last column of the confusion matrix divided by the totla number of samples. Not assigned samples are not considered for the calculation of sensitivity, specificity, error rate and non error rate. <BR>
<BR>
<strong>non error rate</strong> (ner)<BR>
is the average of the class sensitivities:<br>
<center>
  <img src="math_formula_ner.gif" width="151" height="92">
</center>
<BR>
<strong>error rate</strong> (er) <BR>
 is defined as follows:<br>
<center>
  <img src="math_formula_er.gif" width="128" height="28">
</center>
where <em>NER</em> is the non-error rate.<BR>

		        <BR>

ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curves are graphical tools for the analysis of classification results. ROC curves can be calculated only in the <a href="gui.htm" class="lnk_text">graphical interface</a> of the Kohonen and CP-ANN toolbox. A ROC curve is a graphical plot of sensitivity and 1-specificity, for a binary classification system as its discrimination threshold is changed.<br>
A single value of sensitivity and 1-specificity can be calculated from a contingency table and consequently each contingency table represents a single point in the ROC space. For each threshold value, a classification rule is calculated and the respective contingency table is obtained. The best possible classification method would yield a point in the upper left corner of the ROC space, representing maximum sensitivity and specificity, while a random classification give points along the diagonal line from the left bottom to the top right corners. Summarsiing, ROC curves are calculated for each class, separately, by changing the threshold of assignations of output neurons to the considered class from 0 to 1. An example of ROC curves calculated on three classes is shown here (class 1 is perfectly separated, while class 2 and class 3 have a small overlap):<BR>
