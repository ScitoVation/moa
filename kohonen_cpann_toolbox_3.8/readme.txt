Kohonen and CP-ANN toolbox - version 3.8
--------------------------------------------
Kohonen and CPANN toolbox is a collection of MATLAB modules for developing Kohonen Maps, Counterpropagation Artificial Neural networs (CP-ANNs), Supervised Kohonen networks and XY-fused networks. These are well known neural networks aimed to the study of data structure (Kohonen Maps) and to classification purpouses (CP-ANNs, Supervised Kohonen networks, XY-fused networks). 

MATLAB should be installed, while no other toolboxes are needed. 

This is the version 3.8 of Kohonen and CP-ANN toolbox

Kohonen and CPANN toolbox has been released by Milano Chemometrics and QSAR research Group.
